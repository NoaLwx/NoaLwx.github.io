        <h1>Ideas</h1>
            <p>I want to do the relaxation/study aspect so I went and researched some existed websites:</p> 
        <a href="https://www.lofi.cafe">Lofi Cafe</a>
        <a href="https://lifeat.io/category/lofi">Lifeat</a>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>Vibe</h3>
            <p>Most relax website use lofi music and they have generally a very chill vibe. I can find some music for this on Youtube or <a href="https://slip.stream">Slip.stream</a> They also have loop animation for the videos, in which I think I can animated it myself to give my website a sense of uniqueness</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>I really like the aesthetic in Lofi Cafe and how the video change when we click on the arrow keys instead of a button. I will use this in my website for the next video of the same category</p>
            <p>I was wondering of using the same aesthetic of my blog (pixel art) or changing it to a totally different one. But since I want to make this blog continious, I decided to stick with the pixel aesthetic</p>
        <br>

    <div class="evaluation">
        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
            <p>At first I want to make the website into a full screen video but it doesn't match the videos I was working on, so I changed it so that you can change the video by clicking the button</p>
            <br>
            <p>Just like those lofi chill website, I made the video to be play and pause and mute and change the volume, and I also add the function so that people can loop the video without manual clicking on any button to play the video again</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also want to change the progress bar to something customisable so i drew the bar myself.</p>
            <p>At first I was thinking of overlaying the bar image on top of progress bar but then I found out that instead of putting the span progress bar as a colour, I can use image to create the same effect</p> <br>
            <img src="/ass2analyse/img/progress bar.png" width="500">
            <p>I also think about the video and there is not much video abour pokemon that is free to use so I animated them myself and add some royalty music I got from Slip.Stream</p>
            <p>There wasn't much difficulty I faced in this assignment since there is already a structure, but it was fun customising the website and learn new javascript codes on event listener</p>

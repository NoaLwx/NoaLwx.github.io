        <h1>Ideas</h1>
            <p>I want to do the relaxation/study aspect so I went and researched some existed websites:</p>
        <a href="https://www.lofi.cafe">Lofi Cafe</a>
        <a href="https://lifeat.io/category/lofi">Lifeat</a>
        <h3>Vibe</h3>
            <p>Most relax website use lofi music and they have generally a very chill vibe. I can find some music for this on Youtube or <a href="https://slip.stream">Slip.stream</a> They also have loop animation for the videos, in which I think I can animated it myself to give my website a sense of uniqueness</p>
            <p>However, I want my website to have more than just chill. Some people work better under fast pace music so i want to have different category rather than just lofi</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Aesthetic</h3>
            <p>I really like the aesthetic in Lofi Cafe and how the video change when we click on the arrow keys instead of a button. I will use this in my website for the next video of the same category</p>
            <p>I was wondering of using the same aesthetic of my blog (pixel art) or changing it to a totally different one. But since I want to make this blog continious, I decided to stick with the pixel aesthetic</p>

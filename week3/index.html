<h2>Welcome to Interactive Media 1!</h2>

<br><h2>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </h2><br>
- I should make it a fun experience rather than just a block of text and number and images. I need to show peopple my skill, not info dumping them about irrelevant things.
<br><h2>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2> <br>
- The scrolling is a bit laggy without a mouse, however, Alan put up a menu header so if it's unable to scroll, I can still use the menu. 
<br><h2>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </h2><br>
- The animated hand pulling the menu down. That was such a smart move, to show his skill in animating using coding and also showcasing his creativity.

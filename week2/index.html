   <h1>How I see a HTML structure for Alannnn</h1>


<div class="scrolling">

   <div class="side1">
<div class="q1">
    <h2>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
- The animation and the fly that follow my pointer. It adds a really nice personal touch to the website, showing that the person who making this is friendly and funny while having an experienced skillset about coding and websites. 
</div>

<div class="q2">
   <h2> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
- At first, it was unclear what to do, but when I realised I can horizontally scrolling the page, everything is much easier to navigate. The website also has little pages, so it's not too overwhelming and is straight to the point.
</div> 
   </div>

   <div class="side2">
<div class="q3">
   <h2> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
- I like the fly following my pointer and the little animation he made for each page. It was not that much, but it's enough to entertain any visiter of the website.
</div>

<div class="q4">
   <h2> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
- 
</div>
   </div>

   <div class="side3">
<div class="q5">
   <h2> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
- I can clearly see Alan's skillset in designing and making a website, even adding some loop animation for more interactive experience.
</div>
   
<div class="q6">
   <h2> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </h2>
- It's a portfolio page, which is only intended for a few minute of looking through. However, Alan did really well in capturing the attention of his potential clients in the first few second of the experience and further show more of his skill and humour in other part of his website. Anyone who look at this must have been thinking that this was so cool and fun to use. 
</div>
   </div>

   <div class="side4">
<div class="q7">
   <h2> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
- It should only be interacted with for a few minute, because not all clients have time, so it's very straightforward about what he does. 
</div>

<div class="q8">
   <h2> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
- It's a website to showcase Alan's work and experience, and the website is a work itself. Everything from the main menu to the small page inside the website is very well put and display Alan's skill, which is what he want to show to his clients.

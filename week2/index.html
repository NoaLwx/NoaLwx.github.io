    <h1>How I see a HTML structure for downstream game</h1>
    <h2>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? <br></h2>
- the interactiveness of the website. It feels as if you are playing an Unity game rather than an actual wesite <br>
   <h2><br> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. <br></h2>
- the header for "downstream", the name of the game. then there is two div, one is on the left called morton and one is on the right 
saying play the game. Both of them have hovering effect so that when the mouse hovering over, the light change the colour as if it's 
being lighted up. (I want to include this in my blog) <br>
   <h2><br> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? <br></h2>
- the "morton" side where i tried to win the point and click memory game <br>
   <h2><br>  4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? <br></h2>
- clicking and staring at the displaing screen to make sure that i get the right icon <br>
   <h2><br> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? <br></h2>
- it's like an online game rather than a website. this is to promote their upcoming game with the same concept
   <h2><br> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? <br></h2>
- it does feel like playing the game. 
   <h2><br> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) <br></h2>
- they should add more challenge to the game, like flashing light or hidden icon to test people's memory
   <h2><br> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? <br></h2>
- it's a game. you play until you win.

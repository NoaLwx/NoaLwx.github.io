      <h1>How I see a HTML structure for Alannn</h1>
      <h2 id="q1">1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
      <h3 id="a1">- The JSS animation and the fly that follow my pointer. It adds a really nice personal touch to the website, showing that the person who made this is friendly and funny while having an highly experienced skillset about coding and websites.</h3> 
      <a id="door" href="../index.html"><img src="/week2/img/door.jpg" width="376"></a>
      <img id="plant" src="/week2/img/plant.jpg" width="200">
      <h2 id="q2"> 2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
      <h3 id="a2"> Firstly, I tried to figure out how to navigate the website, then when I clicked on Alan's avatar, I continued to scoll and explore the website. I then clicked on any buttons I could see to figure out what those did.</h3>
</div>

<div class="side2">
      <h2 id="q3"> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
      <h3 id="a3">- I like the fly following my pointer and the little animation he made for each page. I tried to click on as much menu/page as possible to see any hidden feature Alan put on his wbsite. It was not that much, but it's enough to entertain any visiter of the website.</h3>
      <img id="clock" src="/week2/img/clock.jpg" width="150">
      <img id="tv" src="/week2/img/tv.PNG" width="900">
      <h2 id="q4"> 4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
      <h3 id="a4">- Scrolling the page and moving my mouse around so that the fly can follow it. It was interesting to find that I can use JSS to make cool feature like that. </h3>
</div>

<div class="side3">
   <div class="five">
   <h2 id="q5"> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
   <h3 id="a5">- I can clearly see Alan's skillset in designing and making a website, even adding some loop animation for more interactive experience.</h3> 
   </div>
   <img id="sofa" src="/week2/img/sofa.jpg" width="800">
   <h2 id="q6"> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal? </h2>
   <h3 id="a6">- It's a portfolio page, which is only intended for a few minute of looking through. However, Alan did really well in capturing the attention of his potential clients in the first few second of the experience and further show more of his skill and humour in other part of his website. Anyone who looks at this must have been thinking that this was so cool and would be great if someone like him works for them. </h3>
</div>

<div class="side4">
   <div id="out">
      <h2 id="q7"> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h2>
      <h3 id="a7">- It should only be interacted with for a few minute, because not all clients have time, so it's very straightforward about what he does.</h3>
      <h2 id="q8"> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
      <h3 id="a8">- It's a website to showcase Alan's work and experience, and the website is a work itself. Everything from the main menu to the small page inside the website is very well put and display Alan's skill, which is what he want to show to his clients.</h3>

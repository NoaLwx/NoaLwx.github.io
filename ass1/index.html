        <h1>NOTE</h1>
        <a href="https://alannn.com/index"><img src="/ass1/img/alan.png"></a>
        <p>For this assignment, I took a lot of inspiration from Alan's website (click on the image above). However, I also added my own theme in, which is being an apartment with rooms and furnitures.</p>
        <p>I like how Alan put a lot of personal ideas and element into the website, making the portfolio more fun to interact with. With this, I decided to make a fun to scroll website, although not as 
        cool or professional as Alan did, I managed to make it quite enjoyable. </p>
        <br><p>Most of the assets and background are drawn by me. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="w2">
        <a href="/week2/index.html"><h1>WEEK 2</h1></a>
        <p>I took inspiration from the horizontal scrolling from Alan's main page.</p> <br>
        <img src="/ass1/img/scroll.gif"> <br>
        <p>If only they have a function to make the website scroll horizontal in one click; but to do this, I had to rotate the whole div 90ยบ anti-clockwise, then rotated the children inside 90ยบ clockwise again. </p> 
        <p>Then, using the display: grid with grid-template-column and grid-template-row, I created the grids to help put in the elements better. </p>
        <br><p>The constrains I had is the margin between the divs are quite hard to calculated, and I didn't use grids before. However, after having the flex box function, it's so much easier.</p>
    </div>
<br>
    <div class="w3">
        <a href="/week3/week3.html"><h1>WEEK 3</h1></a>
        <p>For this page, I took inspiration from the scrolling screen through a laptop.</p>
        <br><img src="/week3/img/animation.gif">
        <p>At first, I tried to put the laptop screen on top of the scrolling screen but I couldn't click anything inside it. So I made the website on a totally different html file and used iframe to put it into the laptop. </p>
        <br><p>The challenging thing was that the laptop doesn't seem to be able to align in the middle of the screen, so I had to put on margin. Otherwise, using grids had been really helpful with a lot of the elements alignment and placement.</p>

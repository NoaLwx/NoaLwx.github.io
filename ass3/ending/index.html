    <!-- this is a very low quality ending to conclude for the game.
    Originally, I planned to make different levels with different characters.
    However, since the code is the same for all level, I might as well as just do one to demostrate 
    what I did -->
    <div id="title">
        And then the detective solved the impossible case of the missing body part murder. Some said he was skilled, some said 
        there might be a force behind this, helping him solve the case. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Whatever the reason is, the victim family was grateful enough for the return of their daughter's head. However, the murderer is still out there, and the dectective needs to find them soon; before he has to find a headless corpse again.
